# üöÄ STEP-BY-STEP: Fix Build & Prepare for Play Store

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

Your build failed because native modules weren't properly compiled. But the good news:

‚úÖ Keystore is configured
‚úÖ Firebase is configured  
‚úÖ All dependencies installed
‚ùå **API URL is pointing to localhost (needs production URL)**
‚ùå **Native modules need compilation (EAS Build will handle this)**

---

## üìã PRE-BUILD CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Set Production Backend URL

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Your app currently connects to `http://10.21.69.205:8000` (your local dev PC). For Play Store, it needs a real production URL!

**Option A: Use Railway (Recommended)**
If your backend is deployed to Railway:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Find your project
3. Copy the deployment URL (looks like `https://your-app-xxxx.up.railway.app`)

**Option B: Use Your Custom Domain**
If you have your own domain:
- Use: `https://yourdomain.com`

**Option C: Use Another Service**
- Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.

---

### Step 2: Update .env for Production

**File:** `c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\.env`

**Current (Development):**
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://10.21.69.205:8000
```

**Change to (Production):**
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

**Example:**
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://act-production-8080.up.railway.app
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:**
- ‚úÖ Must start with `https://` (secure)
- ‚úÖ Must be reachable from the internet
- ‚ùå NOT localhost
- ‚ùå NOT internal IP
- ‚ùå NOT `http://` (must be `https://`)

---

## üèóÔ∏è BUILD PROCESS

### Step 3: Install EAS CLI

```powershell
npm install -g eas-cli
```

Verify it worked:
```powershell
eas --version
```

Expected output: `eas/13.x.x` or higher

---

### Step 4: Create Expo Account (if needed)

1. Go to https://expo.dev
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Enter email and create password
4. Verify email
5. Done!

---

### Step 5: Login to Expo

```powershell
eas login
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Email: Enter your Expo account email
- Password: Enter your Expo account password

Success message:
```
‚úÖ Logged in as your-email@example.com
```

---

### Step 6: Build Release Bundle

Navigate to your mobile app directory:

```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile
```

Build the release AAB:

```powershell
eas build --platform android --type app-bundle
```

**What will happen:**
- EAS will start building in the cloud
- You'll see progress in the terminal
- Build takes 5-10 minutes
- You'll get a download link when complete

**Example output:**
```
‚úÖ Build finished!
üì¶ You can download the build from:
https://eas-builds.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/builds/...
```

---

### Step 7: Download Your AAB File

1. Click the download link from the terminal
2. Or go to https://expo.dev/dashboard
3. Navigate to your project
4. Download the latest build
5. Save it to a safe location

**Output:** File named `app-release.aab` (50-150 MB)

---

## üéØ AFTER BUILD SUCCEEDS

### Step 8: Prepare Play Store Upload

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### "API URL still points to localhost"
**Solution:** Edit `c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\.env` and update `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to your production domain

### "eas command not found"
**Solution:** Install with `npm install -g eas-cli`

### "Not logged in to Expo"
**Solution:** Run `eas login` and enter your Expo credentials

### "Build failed: Could not resolve dependencies"
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen with EAS Build - it handles all native modules automatically. If it does, try:
```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile
eas build --platform android --type app-bundle --clear-cache
```

### "Backend returns 404 errors in production"
**Solution:** Your production backend might have different API paths. Check:
- Backend is running on the production domain
- All endpoints match the app's API calls
- CORS is properly configured
