## ‚è±Ô∏è Build Timeline

### Current Status: Building...

**Typical Timeline:**
1. ‚úÖ **Queued** (0-5 minutes) - Waiting for build server
2. ‚úÖ **In Progress** (15-30 minutes) - Building your app
   - Installing dependencies
   - Compiling native code
   - Creating APK
3. ‚è≥ **Complete** - APK ready for download

**First builds take longer** (15-30 minutes). Subsequent builds are faster due to caching.

## üì• After Build Completes

### 1. Download the APK
- Visit the build URL above
- Click the **Download** button
- Save the APK file to your computer

### 2. Transfer to Your Phone
**Option A: Direct Download**
- Open the build URL on your phone's browser
- Download directly to your phone

**Option B: USB Transfer**
- Connect phone to computer via USB
- Copy APK to phone's Downloads folder

**Option C: Cloud Storage**
- Upload APK to Google Drive/Dropbox

### 3. Install on Your Phone

## üîç What Was Changed

### app.config.js
Made Firebase configuration conditional:
```javascript
// Only adds googleServicesFile if the file exists
const googleServicesPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'google-services.json');
const hasGoogleServices = fs.existsSync(googleServicesPath);

if (hasGoogleServices) {
  androidConfig.googleServicesFile = "./google-services.json";
}
```

**Why?** This allows you to build without Firebase initially. You can add Firebase later for push notifications.

### Package Versions
Fixed version mismatch:
- `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`: 8.4.5 ‚Üí 8.4.4
