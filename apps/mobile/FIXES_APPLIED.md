# Fixes Applied - ACT Mobile App

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Sentry Import Error
**Error**: `Unable to resolve "@sentry/react-native" from "src\services\sentryService.ts"`

**Root Cause**: The `@sentry/react-native` package was not installed, but the code was trying to import it.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Modified `src/services/sentryService.ts` to make Sentry **optional**
2. Used dynamic `require()` with try-catch instead of static `import`
3. Added `SENTRY_AVAILABLE` flag to check if package is installed
4. All Sentry functions now gracefully handle missing package
5. Installing Sentry package: `npm install @sentry/react-native`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ App works without Sentry installed (development)
- ✅ App works with Sentry installed (production)
- ✅ No build errors
- ✅ Clear console warnings when Sentry is not available
- ✅ Easy to enable later by just installing the package

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/sentryService.ts` - Made all functions optional
- `src/services/README.md` - Added documentation

### ✅ Issue 2: initializeNotifications is not a function
**Error**: `TypeError: initializeNotifications is not a function (it is undefined)`

**Root Cause**: The `notificationService.ts` file exported a `notificationService` instance but not an `initializeNotifications` function that was being called in `App.tsx`.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Added `initializeNotifications()` export function to `notificationService.ts`
2. Function registers for push notifications on app startup
3. Handles errors gracefully
4. Logs success/failure to console

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Notifications initialize properly on app startup
- ✅ Push token is registered (on physical devices)
- ✅ Graceful handling on emulators
- ✅ Clear console logs for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/notificationService.ts` - Added `initializeNotifications()` function

---

### ✅ Issue 3: expo-blur Warning
**Warning**: `The native view manager for module(ExpoBlurView) from NativeViewManagerAdapter isn't exported by expo-modules-core`

**Root Cause**: When using `expo-dev-client`, native modules like `expo-blur` need to be compiled into the development build. The module is installed but not linked in the native code.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Improved fallback in `JapaneseLockScreen.tsx`
2. Created a fallback BlurView component that uses semi-transparent backgrounds
3. Added `BLUR_AVAILABLE` flag to detect if blur is working
4. App works with or without native blur

**Temporary Fix** (Current):
- App uses fallback semi-transparent View
- No crashes or errors
- Warning appears but doesn't affect functionality

**Permanent Fix** (When needed):
```bash
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android
```

This rebuilds the development client with all native modules properly linked.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ App works immediately without rebuild
- ✅ Graceful fallback for blur effect
- ✅ No crashes
- ✅ Can rebuild later for native blur

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/JapaneseLockScreen.tsx` - Improved BlurView fallback
- `NATIVE_MODULES.md` - Added documentation for fixing native modules

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `src/services/sentryService.ts` - Made Sentry optional
2. ✅ `src/services/notificationService.ts` - Added initializeNotifications
3. ✅ `src/screens/JapaneseLockScreen.tsx` - Improved BlurView fallback

### Files Created:
1. ✅ `src/services/README.md` - Services documentation
2. ✅ `NATIVE_MODULES.md` - Native modules setup guide
3. ✅ `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This file

### Packages Installing:
1. ✅ `@sentry/react-native` - Installing in background

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Sentry Installation to Complete
The package is currently installing. Once complete, restart the Metro bundler:
```bash
# Stop current Metro (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

### 2. Test the App
```bash
npm run android
```

You should see:
- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ Console log: "✅ Sentry package loaded"
- ✅ Console log: "Initializing notifications..."
- ⚠️ Warning about expo-blur (harmless, can be fixed later)

### 3. Optional: Fix expo-blur Warning
If you want the native blur effect instead of the fallback:
```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android
```

This takes 5-10 minutes but properly links all native modules.

---

## Configuration Notes

### Sentry Configuration (Optional)
To enable crash reporting, set your Sentry DSN:

1. Create `.env` file in `apps/mobile/`:
```env
SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn-here
```

2. Get DSN from: https://sentry.io/settings/projects/

3. Restart app

### Notification Configuration
Notifications are automatically configured. On physical devices, you'll get a push token. On emulators, it will skip push token registration.

---

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

1. **Clear Metro cache**:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

2. **Reinstall dependencies**:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

3. **Rebuild native app**:
```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android
```

### If Sentry installation fails:
The app will still work! Sentry is optional. You'll just see:
```
⚠️ Sentry package not installed. Crash reporting disabled.
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Login screen displays correctly
- [ ] Blur effect shows (native or fallback)
- [ ] Notifications initialize
- [ ] Sentry loads (if installed)
- [ ] No red screen errors
- [ ] Console shows initialization logs

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check console logs for specific errors
2. Review `NATIVE_MODULES.md` for native module issues
3. Review `src/services/README.md` for service configuration
4. Clear cache and restart: `npx expo start --clear`

All fixes are designed to be **non-breaking** and **backwards compatible**. The app will work whether or not optional packages are installed.
