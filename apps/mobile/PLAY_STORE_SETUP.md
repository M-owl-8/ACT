## üîê STEP 1: Create Release Keystore (CRITICAL!)

### Why This Matters
**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: The keystore is the ONLY way to update your app on Play Store!
- **Lose it** = You can NEVER update your app
- **Forget password** = You can NEVER update your app
- **Must create new app** = Lose all users, reviews, downloads

### Generate Keystore

**Option A: Automated Script (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Run the automated keystore generator
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile
.\GENERATE_KEYSTORE.ps1
```

**Option B: Manual Generation**
```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app

keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 `
  -keystore act-release.keystore `
  -alias act-key `
  -keyalg RSA `
  -keysize 2048 `
  -validity 10000
```

**You'll be asked for:**
1. **Keystore password** - Choose a STRONG password (save it!)
2. **Key password** - Use the SAME password as keystore
3. **Your name** - Your company/developer name
4. **Organization** - Your company name
5. **City, State, Country** - Your location

**Example:**
```
Enter keystore password: MyStr0ngP@ssw0rd123!
Re-enter new password: MyStr0ngP@ssw0rd123!
What is your first and last name? [Unknown]: ACT Development Team
What is the name of your organizational unit? [Unknown]: Mobile Development
What is the name of your organization? [Unknown]: ACT
What is the name of your City or Locality? [Unknown]: Tokyo
What is the name of your State or Province? [Unknown]: Tokyo
What is the two-letter country code for this unit? [Unknown]: JP
Is CN=ACT Development Team, OU=Mobile Development, O=ACT, L=Tokyo, ST=Tokyo, C=JP correct? [no]: yes
```

### üîí BACKUP THE KEYSTORE (CRITICAL!)

**Immediately after creating:**

1. **Copy to USB Drive**
   ```powershell
   # Replace D: with your USB drive letter
   Copy-Item "android\app\act-release.keystore" -Destination "D:\ACT_Keystore_Backup\"
   ```

2. **Upload to Cloud Storage**
   - Google Drive
   - OneDrive
   - Dropbox
   - **Make it PRIVATE!**

3. **Save Password Securely**
   - Use password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
   - Or encrypted document
   - **NEVER commit to Git!**

4. **Create a Recovery Document**
   ```
   ACT App Keystore Information
   ============================
   Keystore File: act-release.keystore
   Keystore Password: [YOUR_PASSWORD]
   Key Alias: act-key
   Key Password: [SAME_AS_KEYSTORE]
   Created: [DATE]
   Location: android/app/act-release.keystore
   Backup Locations:
   - USB Drive: D:\ACT_Keystore_Backup\
   - Cloud: [Your cloud storage link]
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è STEP 2: Configure Gradle for Release Signing

### Update gradle.properties

Add these lines to `android/gradle.properties`:

```properties
# Release signing configuration
ACT_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=act-release.keystore
ACT_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=act-key
ACT_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
ACT_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: 
- For production, use environment variables instead
- Never commit passwords to Git
- Add `gradle.properties` to `.gitignore` if it contains passwords

### Update build.gradle

The signing config is already prepared. Just verify it's configured:

```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file(ACT_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
        storePassword ACT_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
        keyAlias ACT_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
        keyPassword ACT_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
    }
}

buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
    }
}
```

## üì¶ STEP 3: Build Release APK/AAB

### Build Android App Bundle (AAB) - Recommended for Play Store

```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android

# Clean build
.\gradlew clean

# Build release AAB
.\gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Output location:**
```
android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### Build APK (Alternative)

```powershell
# Build release APK
.\gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Output location:**
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Verify the Build

```powershell
# Check file size (should be 20-50 MB for AAB)
Get-Item "app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab" | Select-Object Name, Length

# Verify signing
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs "app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab"
```
