## üèóÔ∏è Build Testing

### Debug Build

```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android
.\gradlew assembleDebug
```

**Output:** `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Release Build

```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android
.\gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Output:** `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Bundle Build (for Play Store)

```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android
.\gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Output:** `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### Build Verification

#### Check APK Signature

```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android

# Verify signature
& "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\34.0.0\apksigner.bat" verify --verbose app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

**Expected output:**
```
Verifies
Verified using v1 scheme (JAR signing): true
Verified using v2 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v2): true
Verified using v3 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v3): true
```

#### Check APK Size

```powershell
# Get APK size
(Get-Item "app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk").Length / 1MB

# Should be: 30-50 MB (acceptable for React Native)
```

#### Analyze APK Contents

```powershell
# Extract APK info
& "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\34.0.0\aapt.bat" dump badging app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```
