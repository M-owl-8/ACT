## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why CORS Must Be Fixed First
```python
# BEFORE (DANGEROUS):
ALLOWED = ["*"]  # Any website can attack your API

# AFTER (SAFE):
ALLOWED = ["https://act-production-8080.up.railway.app"]  # Only your app
```

### Why JWT Secret Matters
```
Without fix: Any hacker with source code can forge login tokens
With fix: Only valid users with correct secret can login
```

### Why Firebase Key Needs Restriction
```
Without fix: Hacker can use your key, steal data, abuse billing
With fix: Key works ONLY in your app on your device
```

### Why Expo Project ID Matters
```
Without fix: Your builds go to someone else's account
With fix: Your builds go to YOUR Expo account, you can access them
```

## 📞 QUESTIONS?

### "What if I get stuck?"
→ Open the issue description in `PRODUCTION_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, then follow fix steps in `PLAY_STORE_CRITICAL_FIXES.md`. Ask me if confused!

### "Can I skip any fixes?"
→ No. Google Play Store will reject your app if ANY of these are unfixed.

### "How long will Play Store review take?"
→ Usually 2-4 hours, sometimes up to 24 hours. You'll get email notification.

### "What if my app is rejected?"
→ Google tells you why. You fix it, increment version code, and resubmit. Takes 1-2 hours to fix and resubmit.

### "Is my data safe?"
→ Yes! These fixes MAKE it safe. Before fixes: potentially unsafe. After fixes: fully secure.
