## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (BLOCKING - FIX IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. ‚ùå BACKEND CORS MISCONFIGURATION
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Location:** `/apps/api/main.py` (lines 74-88)  
**Issue:** CORS is set to `"*"` which allows ANY origin to access your API

```python
ALLOWED = [
    # ... development URLs ...
    "*",  # ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY HOLE - Remove this!
]
```

**Risk:** 
- Any website can make requests to your API
- Man-in-the-middle attacks possible
- Data theft vulnerability
- Google Play Store may reject app

**Fix Required:**
```python
ALLOWED = [
    "https://act-production-8080.up.railway.app",  # Your app only
    # Remove "*" completely!
]
```

**Status:** üî¥ NOT FIXED  
**Action:** Edit `/apps/api/main.py` and set proper CORS origins

---

### 2. ‚ùå JWT SECRET NOT CHANGED
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Location:** `/apps/api/.env.production` (line 10)  
**Issue:** JWT secret is placeholder: `"your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-railway-dashboard"`

```env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-railway-dashboard
```

**Risk:**
- Anyone with source code can forge tokens
- Complete authentication bypass
- User data compromise
- Immediate Play Store rejection if discovered

**Fix Required:**
1. Generate a secure 32-character secret:
```powershell
# Run this command:
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
# Output example: "abc123xyz_def456uvw_ghi789jkl012"
```

2. Replace in Railway Dashboard:
   - Go to: https://railway.app ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables
   - Update `JWT_SECRET` with generated value
   - Save and redeploy

**Status:** üî¥ NOT FIXED  
**Action:** Generate and set in Railway immediately

---

### 3. ‚ùå HARDCODED EXPO PROJECT ID
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Location:** `/apps/mobile/app.config.js` (line 65)  
**Issue:** Expo Project ID is hardcoded to development value

```javascript
projectId: process.env.EXPO_PROJECT_ID || "0d2ff065-1b12-4766-b547-3bdeea01cb0a"
```

**Risk:**
- Builds go to wrong Expo account
- Can't submit to EAS Build properly
- Version conflicts and build failures
- Cannot manage production builds

**Fix Required:**

**Option A: Use Environment Variable (Recommended)**
1. In EAS Build, set environment variable:
   ```
   EXPO_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID
   ```

**Option B: Use EAS Init**
```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile
eas init
# This will set up proper project linking
```

**Status:** üî¥ NOT FIXED  
**Action:** Run EAS init or verify Expo project ID

---

### 4. ‚ùå HARDCODED EXPO OWNER
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Location:** `/apps/mobile/app.config.js` (line 69)  
**Issue:** Expo owner is hardcoded to "owl_wilde"

```javascript
owner: process.env.EXPO_OWNER || "owl_wilde"
```

**Risk:** Same as Project ID - builds go to wrong account

**Fix Required:**
```javascript
owner: process.env.EXPO_OWNER || "YOUR_EXPO_USERNAME"
```

Or set in environment before building:
```powershell
$env:EXPO_OWNER = "your-username"
eas build --platform android
```

**Status:** üî¥ NOT FIXED  
**Action:** Update with correct Expo username

---

### 5. ‚ùå FIREBASE API KEY EXPOSED
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Location:** `/apps/mobile/google-services.json` (line 18)  
**Issue:** Firebase API key is publicly visible in source code

```json
{
  "project_info": {
    "project_number": "1071583523463",
    "project_id": "act-gen1-f9812",
    "storage_bucket": "act-gen1-f9812.firebasestorage.app"
  },
  "client": [
    {
      "api_key": [
        {
          "current_key": "AIzaSyAmoswpGMJzRbjRQoYjRNHsjp-3l6cyUM4"  // ‚ö†Ô∏è PUBLIC!
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Risk:**
- Anyone with key can abuse Firebase services
- Potential for data theft
- Billing abuse
- Google Play Store will flag this

**Action Required:**
1. **Restrict Firebase API Key:**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Edit the key and restrict it to:
     - Android apps only
     - Add your package name: `com.act.app`
     - Add your SHA-1 certificate fingerprint

2. **How to get SHA-1:**
   ```powershell
   # If using keystore (after creating it):
   keytool -list -v -keystore "path\to\your\keystore" -alias "key-alias"
   ```

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY SECURED  
**Action:** Restrict Firebase key in console

---

## üü† HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è BACKEND DATABASE URL NOT SET
**Severity:** üü† HIGH  
**Location:** `/apps/api/.env.production` (line 6, commented out)  
**Issue:** Production database URL is commented and not configured

```env
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/railway
```

**Risk:**
- App will fail to connect to database in production
- Users cannot use app
- Railway must be configured with PostgreSQL addon

**Fix Required:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Add PostgreSQL addon to your project
3. Railway auto-sets `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
4. No manual action needed if Railway is configured

**Verification:**
```powershell
# Check if Railway has set it:
# Visit: Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables
# Look for: DATABASE_URL set and starting with "postgresql://"
```

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING RAILWAY SETUP  
**Action:** Verify PostgreSQL addon is created in Railway

---

### 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è CONSOLE.LOG STATEMENTS IN PRODUCTION
**Severity:** üü† HIGH  
**Location:** Multiple files in production code  
**Issues Found:**
- `/apps/mobile/src/services/sentryService.ts`: Multiple console.log calls
- `/apps/mobile/src/api/client.ts`: Line 35-37 console.log statements
- `/apps/api/main.py`: Multiple print statements (less critical)

**Risk:**
- Debugging info exposed to users
- Sensitive URLs and tokens visible in logcat
- Google Play Store may have issues
- Performance impact

**Fix Example - `/apps/mobile/src/api/client.ts` (lines 35-37):**
```typescript
// ‚ùå REMOVE THESE:
console.log("üåê API Base URL:", BASE_URL);
console.log("üì± Platform:", Platform.OS);
console.log("üí° For physical devices, set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL...");
```

```typescript
// ‚úÖ KEEP ONLY IF NEEDED:
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log("üåê API Base URL:", BASE_URL);
}
```

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS FIXING  
**Action:** Remove or guard all console.log statements with `__DEV__` check

---

### 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING PRIVACY POLICY
**Severity:** üü† HIGH (Play Store Requirement)  
**Issue:** No privacy policy URL provided for Play Store submission

**Risk:**
- Google Play Store will REJECT the app without privacy policy
- Required by law in most countries
- Must describe what data you collect

**Fix Required:**
1. **Create Privacy Policy:**

   **Option A: Use Online Generator (5 min)**
   - Visit: https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/
   - Select: "Mobile App"
   - Fill in your details
   - Generate and download

   **Option B: Create Simple One (10 min)**
   - Use template below
   - Host on GitHub Pages or your website

2. **Host Privacy Policy:**
   ```
   Example URL: https://yoursite.com/privacy
   or: https://yourgithub.io/act-privacy
   ```

3. **Sample Privacy Policy Structure:**
   ```
   # Privacy Policy for ACT App

   ## Data Collection
   - Email address (for authentication)

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 9. ‚ö†Ô∏è VERSION CODE NOT PREPARED FOR UPDATES
**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM  
**Location:** `/apps/mobile/app.config.js` (line 11)  
**Issue:** Version code is hardcoded to `1`

```javascript
versionCode: 1,
```

**Risk:**
- Cannot increment for future updates
- All builds have same version
- Must be manually updated for each release

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ OK FOR FIRST RELEASE (v1)
**Future Action:** For v2+, increment:
