# Mission 11 - QA, Testing & Debugging

## üéØ Objective
Ensure everything works across devices, languages, and themes.

- Time periods (Today, Yesterday, Tomorrow, Week, Month, Year)

**Languages Supported**:
- ‚úÖ English (EN)
- ‚úÖ Russian (RU)
- ‚úÖ Uzbek (UZ)

### 3. Navigation Labels - TRANSLATED ‚úì
