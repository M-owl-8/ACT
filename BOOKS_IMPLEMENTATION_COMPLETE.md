## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Seed the Database with Books
```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\api
python seed_books.py
```

**Output:**
```
‚úÖ Added book: The Richest Man in Babylon (en)
‚úÖ Added book: –°–∞–º—ã–π –±–æ–≥–∞—Ç—ã–π —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ –≤ –í–∞–≤–∏–ª–æ–Ω–µ (ru)
‚úÖ Added book: Vavilondagi eng boy odam (uz)
‚úÖ Added book: Atomic Habits (en)
...
‚úÖ Database seeded successfully!
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Books Are in Database
```powershell
python upload_books.py verify
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test the API
```powershell
# Start the server
uvicorn main:app --reload

# In another terminal, test:
# Get books by language
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" http://localhost:8000/books/by-language/en
```

## Database Changes Made ‚úÖ

### Modified Files:

#### 1. `apps/api/models.py`
Added 3 fields to the `Book` model:
```python
language_code = Column(String, default="en", nullable=False, index=True)  # en, ru, uz
file_path = Column(String, nullable=True, index=True)  # e.g., "en/book_1.pdf"
file_size = Column(Integer, nullable=True)  # bytes
```

#### 2. `apps/api/schemas.py`
Updated `BookCreate` and `BookOut` schemas:
```python
class BookCreate(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    language_code: Language = Field(default=Language.en)  # NEW

class BookOut(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    language_code: str  # NEW
    file_path: Optional[str] = None  # NEW
    file_size: Optional[int] = None  # NEW
```

#### 3. `apps/api/routers/books.py`
Updated all book creation/response handling to include new fields.
Added 3 new endpoints:
- `GET /books/by-language/{language_code}` - List books by language
- `POST /books/{book_id}/upload` - Upload PDF file
- `GET /books/{book_id}/download` - Download PDF file

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Database
Option A (Recommended):
```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\api
# Delete old database (if exists)
rm app.db
# Start server - new DB will be created
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Option B:
```powershell
python seed_books.py
```

### Step 2: Verify Books
```powershell
python upload_books.py verify
```

### Step 3: Upload PDFs (Optional)
Place your PDF files here:
```
uploads/books/en/book_10.pdf  # The Richest Man in Babylon
uploads/books/en/book_20.pdf  # Atomic Habits
uploads/books/en/book_30.pdf  # Rich Dad Poor Dad
uploads/books/ru/book_11.pdf  # Russian translations
uploads/books/ru/book_21.pdf
uploads/books/ru/book_31.pdf
uploads/books/uz/book_12.pdf  # Uzbek translations
uploads/books/uz/book_22.pdf
uploads/books/uz/book_32.pdf
```

Then run:
```powershell
python upload_books.py update
```

### Step 4: Test API
```bash
# Get books in English
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8000/books/by-language/en

# Get books in Russian
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8000/books/by-language/ru

# Get books in Uzbek
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8000/books/by-language/uz
```

## Integration with Mobile App

### BooksScreen.tsx Updates Needed:

```typescript
// Add language selector
const [selectedLanguage, setSelectedLanguage] = useState<'en' | 'ru' | 'uz'>('en');

// Load books by language
const loadBooksByLanguage = async () => {
  const response = await api.get(`/books/by-language/${selectedLanguage}`);
  setBooks(response.data);
};

// Add file upload capability
const handleUploadPDF = async (bookId: number, pdfUri: string) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', { uri: pdfUri, type: 'application/pdf', name: 'book.pdf' });
  await api.post(`/books/${bookId}/upload`, formData);
};

// Add file download capability
const handleDownloadPDF = async (bookId: number) => {
  const response = await api.get(`/books/${bookId}/download`);
  // Save and open PDF
};
```

See `MULTI_LANGUAGE_BOOKS_SETUP.md` Part 5 for complete integration code.

## Database Query Examples

```sql
-- Get all books by language
SELECT * FROM books WHERE language_code = 'en' ORDER BY order_index;

-- Get books with uploaded files
SELECT * FROM books WHERE file_path IS NOT NULL;

-- Get file statistics
SELECT 
  language_code,
  COUNT(*) as total_books,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN file_path IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_files,
  SUM(file_size) as total_size_mb
FROM books
GROUP BY language_code;

-- Get a specific book with file info
SELECT id, title, language_code, file_path, file_size 
FROM books 
WHERE id = 10;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No books in database"
**Solution:** Run `python seed_books.py`

### Issue: "File not found" when downloading
**Solution:** Upload file first using `/upload` endpoint or place in `uploads/books/{lang}/` folder

### Issue: "File size exceeds limit"
**Solution:** Maximum file size is 50MB. Split or compress larger PDFs.

### Issue: Database schema error
**Solution:** Delete `app.db` and restart server to recreate with new schema

### Issue: Special characters in filenames cause issues
**Solution:** Files use ID-based names (book_10.pdf) specifically to avoid this

## What's Next?

### Phase 2: Mobile App Integration
1. Add language selector to BooksScreen
2. Implement PDF upload UI
3. Add PDF viewer (react-native-pdf)
4. Track reading progress per language

### Phase 3: Cloud Storage
1. Migrate to AWS S3 or similar
2. Implement CDN for faster downloads
3. Add file compression

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
1. PDF text extraction for search
2. Thumbnail generation
3. Offline reading support
4. Reading annotations/highlights
