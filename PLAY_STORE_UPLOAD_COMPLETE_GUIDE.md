## <a name="keystore-generation"></a>üîê STEP 1: KEYSTORE GENERATION (CRITICAL!)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING - Read This First!

The keystore file is the ONLY way to sign app updates on Google Play Store:
- **Lose the keystore** = You CANNOT update your app ever
- **Forget the password** = You CANNOT update your app
- **Need to create new app** = You lose all user reviews, ratings, downloads

### Create the Keystore File

```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app

# Generate keystore with RSA 2048-bit encryption (valid for ~27 years)
keytool -genkeypair -v `
  -storetype PKCS12 `
  -keystore act-release.keystore `
  -alias act-key `
  -keyalg RSA `
  -keysize 2048 `
  -validity 10000
```

### Answer the Prompts

When prompted, enter the following information:

```
Enter keystore password: [CREATE_A_STRONG_PASSWORD]
Re-enter new password: [SAME_PASSWORD]
What is your first and last name? [Unknown]: ACT Development Team
What is the name of your organizational unit? [Unknown]: Mobile Development
What is the name of your organization? [Unknown]: ACT
What is the name of your City or Locality? [Unknown]: Tokyo
What is the name of your State or Province? [Unknown]: Tokyo
What is the two-letter country code for this unit? [Unknown]: JP
Is CN=ACT Development Team... correct? [no]: yes

Enter key password for <act-key> (RETURN if same as keystore password): [PRESS ENTER]
Re-enter new password: [PRESS ENTER]
```

### Verify Keystore Was Created

```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app

# List keystore contents
keytool -list -v -keystore act-release.keystore -alias act-key

# Check file size (should be ~3KB)
Get-Item act-release.keystore | Select-Object Length
```

### üîí IMMEDIATELY BACKUP YOUR KEYSTORE (DO THIS NOW!)

**Option 1: USB Drive Backup**
```powershell
# Create backup directory on USB
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "D:\ACT_Keystore_Backups" -Force

# Copy keystore
Copy-Item `
  "c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app\act-release.keystore" `
  -Destination "D:\ACT_Keystore_Backups\act-release-backup-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').keystore"
```

**Option 2: Cloud Storage Backup**
1. Go to Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox
2. Upload `act-release.keystore` to a private folder
3. Label it: "ACT App - CRITICAL - Release Keystore"

**Option 3: Password Manager**
1. Open 1Password, LastPass, or Bitwarden
2. Create secure note with:
   - Keystore password
   - Key alias: `act-key`
   - Date created: [today's date]
   - File location: `c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app\act-release.keystore`

---

## <a name="backend-deployment"></a>üîß STEP 2: BACKEND DEPLOYMENT (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

### Why Deploy Backend First?
- Mobile app needs backend URL for production
- Firebase Cloud Messaging requires backend
- Production authentication uses live backend

### Option A: Deploy to Railway (Recommended)

**Step 2.1: Connect Railway Account**

```powershell
# Install Railway CLI globally
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Navigate to API directory
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\api

# Link to Railway project
railway link
```

**Step 2.2: Configure Environment**

```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\api

# Set production variables in Railway dashboard:
# DATABASE_URL: postgresql://...
# JWT_SECRET: [generate-random-secret]
# ENVIRONMENT: production
```

**Step 2.3: Deploy**

```powershell
railway up
```

**Step 2.4: Get Production URL**

After deployment:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Find your ACT project
3. Copy the production URL (e.g., `https://act-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)
4. **Save this URL** - you'll need it for the mobile app

### Option B: Deploy to Heroku (Alternative)

```powershell
# Install Heroku CLI
# Go to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

# Login
heroku login

# Create app
heroku create act-gen1-prod

# Set environment variables
heroku config:set ENVIRONMENT=production

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

### Option C: Self-Hosted (Advanced)

Deploy to your own VPS/server with:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Nginx reverse proxy
- SSL/TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt)

---

## <a name="build-configuration"></a>‚öôÔ∏è STEP 3: BUILD CONFIGURATION

### Update Mobile App for Production

**Step 3.1: Update Environment Variables**

```powershell
# Open mobile .env file
notepad c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\.env
```

Replace with production URL:
```env
# Production deployment (UPDATE THIS URL!)
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://act-production-xxxx.up.railway.app

# Or your backend URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

**Step 3.2: Update app.json with Correct Values**

```powershell
# Open app.json
notepad c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\app.json
```

Key fields to verify/update:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "ACT",
    "slug": "act-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.act.app",
      "versionCode": 1
    },
    "owner": "YOUR_EXPO_USERNAME",
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "YOUR_EAS_PROJECT_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3.3: Update gradle.properties**

```powershell
# Open gradle.properties
notepad c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\gradle.properties
```

Add signing configuration:
```properties
# Release Signing Configuration
ACT_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=act-release.keystore
ACT_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=act-key
ACT_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
ACT_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING**: Never commit passwords to Git!

**Step 3.4: Verify build.gradle Configuration**

The signing configuration should already be in place. Verify at:
`c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app\build.gradle`

Look for:
```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file("../app/act-release.keystore")
        storePassword System.getenv("ACT_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD") ?: ACT_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
        keyAlias System.getenv("ACT_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS") ?: ACT_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
        keyPassword System.getenv("ACT_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD") ?: ACT_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
    }
}

buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
    }
}
```

---

## <a name="release-build"></a>üì¶ STEP 4: BUILD RELEASE APK/AAB

### Option A: Build AAB (Recommended for Play Store)

AAB (Android App Bundle) is required for Google Play Store:

```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android

# Clean previous builds
.\gradlew clean

# Build release bundle
.\gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Verify the build:**
```powershell
# Check output exists
Get-Item "app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab"

# Verify signing
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs "app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab" | Select-Object -First 20
```

**Output location:**
```
c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab
```

### Option B: Build APK (For Testing)

```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android

# Build release APK
.\gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Output location:**
```
c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

### Option C: Use EAS Build (Recommended - Cloud Build)

```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile

# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build for production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

Benefits:
- Builds in the cloud
- No local environment setup needed
- Automatic signing
- Faster builds

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Build Fails with Signing Error

```powershell
# Verify keystore exists
Get-Item c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\app\act-release.keystore

# Verify password is correct
keytool -list -v -keystore act-release.keystore -alias act-key

# Fix: Ensure gradle.properties has correct password
notepad c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile\android\gradle.properties
```

### Build Succeeds but Won't Upload

```powershell
# Verify AAB signing
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab

# Check file size (should be 20-50MB)
Get-Item app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab | Select-Object Length
```

### Play Store Rejects App

1. Read the rejection email entirely
2. Go to: Play Console ‚Üí **Your app** ‚Üí **Setup** ‚Üí **App content**
3. Look for red ‚úó marks and fix them
4. Try resubmitting

### Can't Remember Keystore Password

```
‚ö†Ô∏è If you lose the keystore password, you CANNOT:
- Sign app updates
- Upload new versions
- Modify existing app

ONLY solution: Create new app with new package name
(You lose all reviews, ratings, downloads)

This is why backups are CRITICAL!
```
