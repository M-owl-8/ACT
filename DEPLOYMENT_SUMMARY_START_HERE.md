## 🚀 Deploy in 15 Minutes

### Step 1️⃣: Prepare Firebase Credentials (5 min)

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1"

# Run setup script
.\RAILWAY_COMPLETE_SETUP.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- ✓ Verifies Firebase credentials file exists
- ✓ Encodes it to Base64 automatically
- ✓ Copies the Base64 string to your clipboard
- ✓ Shows exactly what to do next

---

### Step 2️⃣: Set Environment Variables in Railway (3 min)

1. Go to **https://railway.app/dashboard**
2. Select your **ACT Gen-1 API** project
3. Click the **API Service**
4. Go to **Settings → Variables**

Add these 2 variables:

```
Variable Name: JWT_SECRET
Variable Value: VE5pLXN0OFEzLU1wQTg2dGZrMmhYN2pMVVBfOGZzTm5QcmJpNTUyVGhyMQ==

Variable Name: FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON
Variable Value: [PASTE THE BASE64 STRING FROM YOUR CLIPBOARD]
```

**Note:** Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL` from PostgreSQL plugin.

---

### Step 3️⃣: Deploy (2 min)

- **Automatic:** Just save the variables above, Railway redeploys automatically
- **Manual:** Run `railway up` in the API directory

**Check the logs:**
```powershell
railway logs -f
```

**Look for success messages:**
```
✓ [DB] Converting postgresql:// to postgresql+asyncpg://
✓ [Firebase] ✓ Credentials loaded from Base64 environment variable
✓ Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully
✓ Database tables ready
✓ Default data seeded
✓ Daily backup task started
✅ ACT Gen-1 API is ready!
```

---

### Step 4️⃣: Verify Everything Works (3 min)

```powershell
# Run verification script
.\VERIFY_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.ps1

# When prompted, enter your Railway URL:
# https://your-service-code.railway.app
```

This script will test:
- ✓ Health endpoint
- ✓ Firebase initialization
- ✓ Database connection
- ✓ API endpoints
- ✓ Authentication
- ✓ CORS configuration

---

### Step 5️⃣: Update Mobile App (2 min)

Get your Railway URL from: **Railway Dashboard → API Service → Settings → Domains**

Update file: `apps/mobile/src/api/axios-instance.ts`

```typescript
const API_URL = 'https://your-service-code.railway.app';
```

---

## 🎯 Complete Your Production Setup

### Required Tasks (Must Do)

- [ ] **Step 1:** Run `.\RAILWAY_COMPLETE_SETUP.ps1`
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add variables to Railway dashboard (2 variables)
- [ ] **Step 3:** Wait for auto-deployment (~2 minutes)
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `.\VERIFY_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.ps1`
- [ ] **Step 5:** Update mobile app with production URL

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes
**Difficulty:** Low (just configuration, no coding)

---

## 📋 What Each Configuration Does

### config.py (Backend Configuration)
**Purpose:** Load and manage all settings

**New Capability:** Handles Firebase credentials in two ways:
1. **Local:** Direct file path to `firebase-service-account.json`
2. **Production:** Base64-encoded JSON in `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` environment variable

**Automatic:** Detects which method to use and configures accordingly

---

### main.py (FastAPI App)
**Purpose:** Initialize the application

**Updated:** CORS origins now have clear comments
- Look for: `# UPDATE: Add your Railway domain here!`
- Uncomment and add your Railway domain when deploying

**Before deploying:** Update CORS with your Railway URL

---

### Procfile (Start Command)
**Purpose:** Tells Railway how to start the backend

**Command:** `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

**No changes needed** - already perfect

---

### railway.json (Railway Config)
**Purpose:** Railway-specific deployment settings

**Already configured for:**
- Auto-scaling
- Automatic restarts on failure
- Proper Python environment detection

**No changes needed** - already perfect

---

## 🔒 Security Summary

Your production deployment includes:

✅ **JWT Authentication**
- 15-minute access tokens
- 14-day refresh tokens
- Argon2 password hashing

✅ **Database Security**
- PostgreSQL (managed by Railway)
- Connection pooling
- Encrypted credentials

✅ **Firebase Security**
- Credentials stored as Base64 in environment
- Never exposed in logs or git
- Service account with limited permissions

✅ **Network Security**
- HTTPS enforced by Railway
- CORS protection
- Error messages don't leak info

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Firebase Not Initializing
```
Error: "Firebase credentials not found"
Fix: Check FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON is set correctly
```

### Database Not Connecting
```
Error: "Failed to connect to postgresql"
Fix: Wait 30 seconds for Railway to inject DATABASE_URL, then redeploy
```

### CORS Errors
```
Error: "Origin not allowed" from mobile app
Fix: Add your Railway domain to ALLOWED list in main.py, redeploy
```
