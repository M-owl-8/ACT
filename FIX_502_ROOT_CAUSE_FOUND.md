# 🔥 ROOT CAUSE FOUND - 502 FIX COMPLETE

## The Problem (Both Parts)

You were getting 502 because of **TWO issues combined**:

### Issue #1: Backend Not Listening Correctly ❌
```
Backend was started as: uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
This binds to 127.0.0.1 (localhost ONLY)
Android emulator CANNOT reach 127.0.0.1
```

**Result:** Connection refused → 502 error

### Issue #2: App Configured for Production 🌍
Your `.env` file had:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://act-production-8080.up.railway.app
```

Even if the local backend was working, the app was trying to connect to Railway production server!

---

## The Solution ✅

### Fix #1: Backend Binding (DONE)
Changed startup to bind to all interfaces:
```powershell
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
                                    ↑
                            This makes it accessible
```

### Fix #2: App Configuration (DONE)
Changed `.env` to use local backend:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000  ✅
```

---

## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### ⚠️  CRITICAL: Clear Metro Cache & Restart App

The `.env` change requires a full app restart:

#### Step 1: Stop Everything
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C on all running terminals (metro, backend, emulator)
```

#### Step 2: Clear Metro Cache
```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

#### Step 3: In Another Terminal - Start Backend
```powershell
c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\FIX_502_FINAL_PERMANENT.ps1
```

#### Step 4: In Another Terminal - Run App
```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\mobile
npx expo run:android
```

## How to Verify It's Working

### Test 1: Check Backend is Accessible
Open browser: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Should see API documentation ✅

### Test 2: Check App Logs
Look for:
```
LOG  🌐 API Base URL: http://10.0.2.2:8000
     ↑ Should show LOCAL backend, NOT production!
```

### Test 3: Try Registration
Try to register in the app:
```
✅ Should work WITHOUT 502 error
```

## Understanding the Fix

```
WINDOWS COMPUTER (You)          ANDROID EMULATOR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━           ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                                    
FastAPI Backend                  Mobile App
  Listening on                     Tries to connect
  0.0.0.0:8000 ✅                 http://10.0.2.2:8000 ✅
  
You access:
  • localhost:8000 ✅
  • 127.0.0.1:8000 ✅
  • 10.0.2.2:8000 ✅ (from emulator)
```

**Key:** Binding to `0.0.0.0` makes backend listen on ALL interfaces!

## Troubleshooting

**Still getting 502?**
1. Check `.env` file - make sure it says `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
2. Check app logs - should show local URL, not production
3. Run `npm start -- --reset-cache` to clear metro bundler cache
4. Uninstall and reinstall the app on emulator

**Backend shows "Address already in use"?**
- Run `FIX_502_FINAL_PERMANENT.ps1` - it auto-kills port 8000

**App still showing production URL?**
- You didn't clear the cache
- Run `npm start -- --reset-cache`
- If using Expo Go, reinstall it

## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

👉 **Do this in order:**

1. **Stop all terminals** (Ctrl+C everywhere)

2. **Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
   ```powershell
   .\FIX_502_FINAL_PERMANENT.ps1
   ```

3. **Terminal 2 - Clear Cache & Start Metro:**
   ```powershell
   cd apps\mobile
   npm start -- --reset-cache
   ```
   Press `a` for Android

4. **Let app run** - Registration should work! ✅

**That's it! This should fix it permanently.** 🎉
