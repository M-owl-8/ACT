## 🔐 CRITICAL SECURITY NOTES

### Keystore Security (READ THIS!)

The keystore file is **THE ONLY WAY** to update your app on Play Store:

❌ **IF YOU LOSE IT:**
- You CANNOT update your app
- You CANNOT fix bugs
- You CANNOT add features
- You must create new app (lose all reviews/ratings)

**ACTION ITEMS:**
1. ✅ Generate keystore (follow Step 1 above)
2. ✅ Backup to USB drive (right now!)
3. ✅ Backup to cloud storage (Google Drive)
4. ✅ Save password in password manager (1Password, LastPass)
5. ✅ Create recovery document with all details
6. ✅ Never commit keystore to Git

### Password Management

**gradle.properties:**
- Contains keystore password
- **NEVER commit to Git**
- Add `gradle.properties` to `.gitignore`

---

## 🆘 COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Do I need to deploy the backend first?
**A:** Optional but recommended. The app will work with any backend URL. Set in `.env`.

### Q: Can I test on physical device first?
**A:** Yes! Run: `npm run android` on a connected device.

### Q: What if Play Store rejects my app?
**A:** Read the rejection email. Common fixes:
- Update API target level
- Verify privacy policy URL works
- Add missing permissions explanation

### Q: How do I update the app after launch?
**A:** Update version code in app.json, rebuild AAB, upload to Play Console, submit.

### Q: Do I need an iOS build for Play Store?
**A:** No! Play Store is Android only. iOS uses App Store.

### Q: Can I make the app paid instead of free?
**A:** Yes! Change in Play Console before submitting.
