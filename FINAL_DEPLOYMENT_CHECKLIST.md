## üöÄ Quick Start: Complete Deployment in 5 Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Firebase Credentials (5 min)
```powershell
# Run this script to encode Firebase credentials
Set-Location "c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1"
.\RAILWAY_COMPLETE_SETUP.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úì Verifies Firebase credentials file exists
- ‚úì Encodes it to Base64
- ‚úì Copies to clipboard automatically
- ‚úì Shows you exactly what to paste

---

### Step 2: Set Up Railway Environment Variables (3 min)

**Option A: Via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to [Railway.app Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select **ACT Gen-1 API** project
3. Click the **API Service**
4. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Variables**
5. Add these variables:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | `VE5pLXN0OFEzLU1wQTg2dGZrMmhYN2pMVVBfOGZzTm5QcmJpNTUyVGhyMQ==` |
| `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | *Paste the Base64 string from Step 1 clipboard* |

6. **DATABASE_URL** is automatically provided by Railway's PostgreSQL plugin

**Option B: Via Railway CLI**
```powershell
railway login
railway link
railway variables set JWT_SECRET "VE5pLXN0OFEzLU1wQTg2dGZrMmhYN2pMVVBfOGZzTm5QcmJpNTUyVGhyMQ=="
railway variables set FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON "[paste-base64-here]"
```

---

### Step 3: Deploy (Automatic or Manual)

**Option A: Automatic Deployment**
- Just save the variables in Railway dashboard
- Railway automatically redeploys when variables change

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\user\Desktop\Bitway\Programs\act-gen1\apps\api"
railway up
```

**Watch the deployment:**
```powershell
railway logs -f
```

---

### Step 4: Verify Deployment Success (2 min)

Look for these success messages in Railway logs:

```
‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS IN LOGS:
‚úì [DB] Converting postgresql:// to postgresql+asyncpg://
‚úì [Firebase] ‚úì Credentials loaded from Base64 environment variable
‚úì Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully
‚úì Database tables ready
‚úì Default data seeded
‚úì Daily backup task started
‚úÖ ACT Gen-1 API is ready!
```

**Test the API:**
```powershell
# Get your Railway URL from Settings ‚Üí Domains
# Run this verification script:
.\VERIFY_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.ps1
```

---

### Step 5: Update Mobile App (2 min)

Find your Railway URL from the API service **Settings ‚Üí Domains**

Update mobile app in: `apps/mobile/src/api/axios-instance.ts`
```typescript
const API_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? 'https://your-railway-app.railway.app'  // ‚Üê Update this
    : 'http://localhost:8000';
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "Firebase credentials not found"
**Solution:**
1. Verify `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` variable is set in Railway
2. Check that Base64 encoding was done correctly
3. Run `railway logs` to see the exact error
4. Use Volume Mount option if Base64 doesn't work

### Problem: Database Connection Failed
**Solution:**
1. Verify PostgreSQL plugin is added to Railway project
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` format: should start with `postgresql://`
3. Wait 30 seconds for Railway to inject the variable
4. Redeploy the app if variable was just added

### Problem: CORS Errors from Mobile
**Solution:**
1. Get your Railway domain from Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add it to `ALLOWED` list in `main.py`
3. Redeploy the backend
4. Update mobile app API URL to match

### Problem: Port Already in Use (Local Testing)
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Kill process on port 8000
Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000).OwningProcess -Force
```

### Problem: Firebase Admin SDK Not Installed
**Solution:**
```powershell
# In backend directory with venv activated
pip install firebase-admin
```

### Problem: Logs Not Showing
**Solution:**
```powershell
# View live logs
railway logs -f

# Or tail last 100 lines
railway logs -l 100
```
