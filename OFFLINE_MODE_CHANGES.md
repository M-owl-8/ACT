# Offline Mode Changes - Summary

## 🎯 What Changed

The app has been converted from a backend-dependent authentication system to a **fully offline-first application** with local data storage only.

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. **Authentication System Removed** 
- ❌ Removed login/signup screens
- ❌ Removed backend API authentication
- ❌ Removed token storage and refresh logic
- ✅ Replaced with automatic guest user login

**File: `src/store/auth.ts`**
- Auto-creates a guest user on app startup
- All data is now local-only
- No backend communication required
- App works 100% offline

#### 2. **Navigation Updated**
- ❌ Removed conditional rendering based on user login
- ✅ App now always shows main dashboard
- Users skip login screens entirely
- Direct access to: Home, Add, Reports, Reminders, Goals, Settings

**File: `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`**
- Removed imports: LoginScreen, RegisterScreen, ForgotPasswordScreen
- Removed auth check logic
- Always renders MainTabs component

#### 3. **Data Storage**
- ✅ All data stored locally using SQLite (Expo SQLite)
- ✅ Data persists on device only
- ✅ No cloud sync
- ✅ Each device has independent data

**File: `src/services/database.ts`** (unchanged, already supported)
- Tables: users, categories, entries, books, reminders, etc.
- All CRUD operations work locally

## 📱 How Users Will Experience It

1. **App Startup**: Opens directly to home screen (no login needed)
2. **Add Expenses**: All added to local database
3. **Reports**: Generated from local data only
4. **Settings**: Changes saved locally
5. **Offline First**: Works without internet connection
6. **Data Preservation**: Data remains after app restart (on same device)

---

## 🔄 Data Migration Notes

**If you had existing backend data:**
- ⚠️ Backend data is not migrated automatically
- Users start fresh with an empty local database
- To add default data, modify `src/services/database.ts` in the `seedDefaultData()` function

## 🔧 API Client Behavior

**Important:** The API client is still configured but won't be used for authentication.

Files that reference API (no changes needed yet):
- `src/api/client.ts` - HTTP client configuration
- Screens may still have optional API calls (gracefully fail offline)

If you want to completely remove API dependencies later:
- Search for `API.` in screens
- Remove or make optional any backend API calls

---

## 📦 What's Included

- ✅ Local SQLite database
- ✅ Offline functionality
- ✅ i18n (multi-language support)
- ✅ Theme system
- ✅ Notifications (local only)
- ✅ All screens working with local data

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I add login back?**
A: Yes, revert the changes to `auth.ts` and `AppNavigator.tsx`

**Q: How do users backup their data?**
A: Currently, no backup functionality. You could add:
- CSV export feature
- JSON export feature
- Cloud sync (requires backend)

**Q: Can multiple users use the same device?**
A: Currently no. Each install is one guest user. To support multiple users, you'd need to implement local user switching.
