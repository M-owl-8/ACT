## 🎯 CRITICAL PATH - DON'T SKIP

These steps are REQUIRED. Don't skip any:

```
1. ✅ Testing (Week 1) - Catches bugs before launch
   └─ Don't skip: App will crash on users' devices
   
2. ✅ Production Deploy (Week 2) - Live server required
   └─ Don't skip: Users can't access app backend
   
3. ✅ Store Assets (Week 2-3) - Screenshots/descriptions
   └─ Don't skip: Can't submit to Play Store
   
4. ✅ Store Submission (Week 4) - Official review
   └─ Don't skip: App won't be published
   
5. ✅ Address Feedback (Week 4-5) - Fix review issues
   └─ Don't skip: App rejected, delayed launch
   
6. ✅ Publish (Week 5+) - Go live!
   └─ Don't skip: App never reaches users
```
