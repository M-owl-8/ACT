# 🔧 Fix for 422 Login Error - Comprehensive Guide

## ❌ Problem Identified

You were getting a **422 Unprocessable Entity** error when trying to login:
```
ERROR  ❌ Login error: [AxiosError: Request failed with status code 422]
ERROR  Error details: {"code": "ERR_BAD_REQUEST", "message": "Request failed with status code 422", "response": {"detail": [[Object]]}, "status": 422}
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

The `RegisterScreen` was only sending 2 fields to the backend:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Missing recovery_keyword
API.post('/auth/register', {
  email: data.email,
  password: data.password
})
```

But the backend `UserCreate` schema requires 3 fields:
```python
class UserCreate(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr                                    # ✅ Sent
    password: str = Field(min_length=8, max_length=100)  # ✅ Sent
    recovery_keyword: str = Field(min_length=3, max_length=100)  # ❌ MISSING!
```

This caused a **422 Validation Error** when you tried to register, preventing account creation. Then login failed because the account didn't exist.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **RegisterScreen.tsx** - Added Recovery Keyword Field

**Before:**
```typescript
const res = await API.post('/auth/register', {
  email: data.email,
  password: data.password
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const res = await API.post('/auth/register', {
  email: data.email,
  password: data.password,
  recovery_keyword: data.recovery_keyword  // ✅ NOW INCLUDED
});
```

### 2. **UI Improvements**

Added a new input field for recovery keyword:
- Label: "Recovery Keyword"
- Helper text: Explains it's used for password reset
- Validation: Min 3 characters required
- Placeholder: "e.g., FavoriteAnimal2024"

### 3. **Better Error Messages**

Enhanced error handling to show:
- **422 Errors**: Clear message about required fields
- **401 Errors**: Suggests registering first if needed
- Specific validation feedback

## 📋 Required Fields Summary

| Field | Requirements | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Email | Valid email format | `user@example.com` |
| Password | 8-100 characters | `SecurePass123` |
| Recovery Keyword | 3-100 characters | `FavoritePet2024` |

## 🔑 What's Recovery Keyword For?

The recovery keyword is a **backup security measure**:
- Used to reset your password if you forget it
- NOT your password - just a memorable phrase
- Only you should know it
- Should be something you'll remember long-term

**Example scenario:**
1. You forget your password
2. Go to password reset
3. Enter email + recovery keyword
4. Get option to create new password
5. Login again
