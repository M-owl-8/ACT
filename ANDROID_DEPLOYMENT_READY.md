2. Test locally: `npm start`
3. Build dev APK when ready for phone testing
4. Install and test on phone

### Pre-Production Testing
1. Build preview APK: `.\BUILD_ANDROID.ps1 -Profile preview`
2. Test thoroughly on phone
3. Share with beta testers
4. Fix any issues

## üîß Useful Commands

```powershell
# View all your builds
eas build:list

# View specific build details
eas build:view [BUILD_ID]

# Manage credentials (keystore)
eas credentials

# View project info
eas project:info

# Submit to Play Store (after setup)
eas submit --platform android --latest
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Keystore Management
- EAS will automatically create and manage your Android keystore
- This keystore is used to sign your app
- **NEVER lose your keystore** - you can't update your app without it
- EAS stores it securely in the cloud
- You can download it: `eas credentials`

### Version Management
- **version:** User-facing version (e.g., "1.0.0", "1.0.1", "1.1.0")
- **android.versionCode:** Must be an integer and must increase with each Play Store upload
- Play Store requires new versionCode for each upload

### Security
- ‚úÖ `google-services.json` is in `.gitignore` - don't commit it
- ‚úÖ `google-play-service-account.json` is in `.gitignore` - don't commit it
- ‚úÖ Never commit API keys or secrets to git
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for sensitive data

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```powershell
# View build logs
eas build:view [BUILD_ID]

# Clear cache and retry
eas build --clear-cache --platform android --profile development
```

### Can't Install APK on Phone
1. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Android settings
2. Check if you have enough storage space
3. Try uninstalling previous version first

### Firebase Not Working
1. Verify `google-services.json` is in `apps/mobile/` directory
2. Check package name in Firebase matches: `com.act.app`
3. Rebuild app after adding Firebase config
