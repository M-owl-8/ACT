================================================================================
                            🔐 CRITICAL REMINDERS
================================================================================

⚠️  KEYSTORE SECURITY:
    • Generate keystore FIRST
    • Backup to USB immediately (do this NOW, not later!)
    • Backup to cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)
    • Save password securely (password manager)
    
    ❌ IF YOU LOSE THE KEYSTORE:
       You CANNOT update your app
       You CANNOT fix bugs
       You CANNOT add features
       You must create brand new app (lose all reviews!)

⚠️  PASSWORDS:
    • gradle.properties contains keystore password
    • NEVER commit this file to Git
    • Add to .gitignore
    • Use password manager

⚠️  PRIVACY POLICY:
    • REQUIRED by Google Play
    • Must be HTTPS URL (not HTTP)
    • Must be accessible
    • Can use privacy policy generator at: https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/
