# üîß PLAY STORE: CRITICAL FIXES & DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## üìç YOU ARE HERE
Your EAS build is running. While it completes, we're fixing the 8 blocking issues to ensure your app is production-ready.

---

## üö® PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (2-3 Hours)

### FIX #1: Backend CORS Security
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Risk Level:** üî¥ CRITICAL

#### Problem
Backend allows ANY origin to access your API (`"*"`)

#### Solution

**Step 1: Open File**
```powershell
code "c:\work\act-gen1\apps\api\main.py"
```

**Step 2: Find and Replace (Lines 74-88)**

‚ùå **BEFORE:**
```python
ALLOWED = [
    # Development URLs
    "https://nine-turtles-serve.loca.lt",
    "https://*.exp.direct",       # Expo web
    "http://localhost:19006",     # Expo web local
    "http://127.0.0.1:19006",
    "http://localhost:8081",      # Expo mobile
    "http://127.0.0.1:8081",
    
    # Production URLs
    # "https://your-railway-app.railway.app",  # ‚Üê UNCOMMENT and update with your Railway domain
    
    # Temporary for testing (remove in production)
    "*",  # ‚Üê DELETE THIS LINE!
]
```

‚úÖ **AFTER:**
```python
ALLOWED = [
    # Production URL (CRITICAL: Only your app!)
    "https://act-production-8080.up.railway.app",
    
    # Development URLs (optional, only if developing)
    # "https://nine-turtles-serve.loca.lt",
    # "https://*.exp.direct",
    # "http://localhost:19006",
    # "http://127.0.0.1:19006",
    # "http://localhost:8081",
    # "http://127.0.0.1:8081",
]
```

**Step 3: Verify**
- Save file (Ctrl+S)
- Check lines 74-88 look correct
- ‚úÖ No `"*"` present

**Step 4: Deploy**
```powershell
# Push to Railway
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\api
git add .
git commit -m "SECURITY: Fix CORS to production URL only"
git push origin main
```

‚úÖ **Verify Deployment:**
- Go to Railway dashboard
- See "Deployed" status
- New build with proper CORS

---

### FIX #2: Backend JWT Secret
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Risk Level:** üî¥ CRITICAL

#### Problem
JWT secret is placeholder string, anyone with code can forge tokens

#### Solution

**Step 1: Generate Secure Secret**
```powershell
# Run this command:
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Output will be something like:
# "EzVxB5mK3pL7nQ2vJ8wR4sT9xC6yD1fG_hI0aJ2bK4c"

# ‚¨ÜÔ∏è COPY THIS VALUE
```

**Step 2: Set in Railway**

1. Open: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your project (act-gen1)
3. Click "Variables" tab
4. Find or create `JWT_SECRET` variable
5. **Replace value** with the secret you just generated
6. Click "Save" or press Enter
7. Wait for redeploy (see status: "Deployed")

**Step 3: Verify**
- Railway shows "Deployed" status ‚úÖ
- Terminal shows restart message ‚úÖ

---

### FIX #3: Backend Database URL
**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Risk Level:** üü† HIGH

#### Verify Setup

1. Open: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Plugins" or "Add Service"
4. Look for "PostgreSQL" plugin
5. If present ‚úÖ - Database is configured
6. If missing ‚ùå - Click "Add PostgreSQL"

**Railway Auto-Sets:**
- `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- All connection details
- No action needed from you

**Verification Command:**
```powershell
# In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Variables
# Should see something like:
# DATABASE_URL = postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:5432/railway
```

‚úÖ If you see it, you're good!

---

### FIX #4: Firebase API Key Restriction
**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Risk Level:** üî¥ CRITICAL

#### Problem
Firebase API key is publicly visible and unrestricted

#### Solution

**Step 1: Get Your App's SHA-1 Fingerprint**

You need SHA-1 of your signing key. For now, we'll use the debug key:

```powershell
# Check if debug keystore exists:
Test-Path "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.android\debug.keystore"

# If yes, get SHA-1:
keytool -list -v -keystore "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

**Look for:** `SHA1:` line, copy the value  
**Example:** `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA:BB:CC:DD`

**Step 2: Open Firebase Console**

1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project: "act-gen1-f9812"
3. Go to: Settings ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí Project Settings
4. Click: "Service Accounts" tab
5. Scroll to: "API Keys" section
6. Find key: "AIzaSyAmoswpGMJzRbjRQoYjRNHsjp-3l6cyUM4"
7. Click the key to edit

**Step 3: Restrict to Android**

In API Key editor:
1. Scroll to: "Application restrictions"
2. Select: "Android apps"
3. Click: "Add package name and fingerprint"
4. Enter:
   - **Package name:** `com.act.app`
   - **SHA-1 fingerprint:** (your value from Step 1)
5. Click: "Save"

**Step 4: Save API Restrictions**
- Save changes
- Wait 2-5 minutes for changes to apply

‚úÖ Now only your app can use this key!

---

### FIX #5: Expo Project ID & Owner
**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Risk Level:** üî¥ CRITICAL

#### Problem
Hardcoded Expo IDs point to wrong account

#### Solution

**Step 1: Initialize EAS Project**
```powershell
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile

# This will set up everything correctly
eas init
```

**Step 2: Follow Prompts**
```
‚úî Choose a project: (Select your Expo project)
‚úî Set up EAS Build? Yes
‚úî Set up EAS Submit? Yes (optional)
```

**Step 3: What Gets Updated**
- `eas.json` - updated with project ID
- `.expo/` directory - project configuration
- Your account linked properly

**Step 4: Verify**
```powershell
# Check eas.json
cat eas.json

# Should show your project ID
```

‚úÖ Now your builds go to the right account!

---

### FIX #6: Remove Console.log Statements
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Risk Level:** üü† HIGH

#### Problem
Debug statements leak in production builds

#### Solution

**Step 1: Open Files in VS Code**
```powershell
code c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile
```

**Step 2: Find & Replace**
- Press: `Ctrl + Shift + H` (Find and Replace)
- Search in: `./src` folder

**Files to Check:**
1. **src/api/client.ts** (lines 35-37)
   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå REMOVE:
   console.log("üåê API Base URL:", BASE_URL);
   console.log("üì± Platform:", Platform.OS);
   console.log("üí° For physical devices...");
   ```
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ REPLACE WITH (optional debug only):
   if (__DEV__) {
     console.log("üåê API Base URL:", BASE_URL);
   }
   ```

2. **src/services/sentryService.ts** (multiple lines)
   - Keep lines that say `__DEV__`
   - Remove plain `console.log()` calls
   - Or wrap all in `if (__DEV__) { ... }`

3. **Other files**
   - Search for `console.log` in entire src
   - Remove or guard with `__DEV__` check

**Step 3: Verify**
```powershell
# Search for remaining console.log
cd c:\work\act-gen1\apps\mobile
grep -r "console\.log" src/

# Should return: 0 results (or only inside __DEV__ guards)
```

‚úÖ No debug logs in production!
