## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Structure

#### New Endpoint: `/entries/stats/totals`
```python
GET /entries/stats/totals?type=income&start_date=...&end_date=...

Response:
{
  "total": 5000.00,
  "count": 12,
  "type": "income",
  "start_date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00",
  "end_date": "2025-01-31T23:59:59"
}
```

**Features:**
- Filters by entry type (income/expense)
- Filters by date range
- Returns sum of amounts and count
- Handles empty results gracefully

#### Existing Endpoints Enhanced
All existing entry endpoints support:
- Type filtering (`type=income`)
- Date range filtering (`start_date`, `end_date`)
- Category filtering
- Pagination (limit, offset)
